# Time Density: A Theoretical Framework for Variability in Light Speed and Local Space-Time Behavior
This paper introduces the concept of time density (ρt) as a fundamental scalar
field influencing the apparent behavior of light, gravitation, and matter. We propose
that local variations in ρt affect the effective speed of light, introduce refractive-like
effects in spacetime, and may account for phenomena currently attributed to dark
matter, dark energy, and cosmic inflation. The theory is explored through dimensional
analysis, derived equations, testable predictions, and a philosophical interpretation of
time as a physical medium.
